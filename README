Important note!
---------------

Unfortunately, this project is no longer maintained. I moved it from
Google Code to Github after the shutdown notice. The code is here
for reference only. Maybe somebody finds this useful. You never know.
Long live TMRM!

Contents of the old README-file:


Creating the database
---------------------

Currently, libtmrm only implements a postgresql backend. The database user 
(postgres), the name of the database (tmrm_test) and the database server 
(localhost) are hardcoded in the test suite test/tmrm_tests.c. *YIKES!*

The schema of the database can be found in the sql/ directory. libtmrm does
not (yet) create the schema automatically, so you have to create the tables
by hand. Remember to set the permissions right!



Building libtmrm
----------------

libtmrm has the following requirements:

 * LibYAML (http://pyyaml.org/wiki/LibYAML)
 * PostgreSQL (http://www.postgresql.org)
   8.x is fine, older versions might work as well. This is the only 
   supported backend right now. Later versions of libtmrm will support
   BerkeleyDB and an in-memory implementation
 * Check (http://check.sourceforge.net) for unit testing
 * more dependencies to come!

Build the package:
./configure --with-yaml=/prefix/to/libyaml \
    --with-postgresql=yes
make
# make install

Se README.osx for details (especially for switches to the configure command
when building libtmrm with libraries from mac ports.


Running the test suite
----------------------

There is no main program, so you might want to run the test suite to see
libtmrm in action.


To run the test suite run the following command from the main directory:

make check


Have fun!
